# STOR 390 Final Project: "Statistical Approaches for Assessing Disparate Impact in Fair Housing Cases" Analysis of Methods and Normative Considerations

This repository hosts files for my STOR 390 final project submission--a pdf and rmd file of my paper, as well as csv files of the data used to replicate the methods presented in my selected paper. 

In "Statistical Approaches for Assessing Disparate Impact in Fair Housing Cases", Dennis J. Aigner, Marco del √Ångel, & Joel Wiles examine and test three approaches to statistically proving disparate impact of a housing policy on a protected group. This paper analyzes their evaluative methodologies and tests them on an unweighted novel income dataset, as well as assesses normative considerations behind developing defensible statistical inference techniques from a Rawlsian and Deontological viewpoint.
